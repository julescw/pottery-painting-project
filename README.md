# Pottery Painting Project
Ongoing personal coding project: Pottery Painting Store Order Management Software in C

# What is this? 
I worked at a pottery painting store for a few months and learned that their order system was entirely paper-based. Due to their complex and individual needs, it was difficult to find a solution online that could work with their workflow and process. I am in the process of writing this program to fill this gap, having already cemented custom data structures and now moving on to using JSON for the first time to store the information!
